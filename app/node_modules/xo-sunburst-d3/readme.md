the parameters are : 

* `chart-data` : node object : If some nodes have a size of zero, but can get a value later on, you should add them now, so the animation is pretty. Each node should have at least 
	* `size` : numeric (mandatory for leaf node). used to compute arc size
	* `children` : array of children 
	* `textSize` : used for text representation of size
* `selected` : read/write : the current selected node
* `over` : function(node) the current node with mouse over
* `click` : function(node) the clicked node
* `log` : true/false : use logarithmic scale (default : false)
